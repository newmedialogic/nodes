Generates a minimal model and controller for managing a single content type
(Post, Announcement, Page, etc) in the Nodes content management system. The
model and controller have virtually no code in them. The model contains a
single macro method to register it as a Nodes model. The controller just
inherits from a Nodes controller class that implements the basic CMS features.
